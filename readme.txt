Give your default avatars some text and color love, inspired by Gmail.

== Description ==

Quit using dull faces or abstract images to identify your (Gr)avatar-less users and commenters. This plugin generates stylish colorful default avatars like the default user pictures seen in Gmail on iOS (Chrome + [iPhone](http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-21-at-9.55.02-PM.jpg) and [iPad](http://img.creativemark.co.uk/uploads/images/995/14995/img3File.jpg) app) and [Android](http://cdn.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/postimages/444537/new-gmail-2.png). It uses the users first letter or number from the users display name. Looks great on white backgrounds.

The default avatars are generated by free placeholder services. Currently the following services are included:
* [Cambelt](http://cambelt.co)
* [Dummy Image](http://dummyimage.com)
* [Get Dummy Image](http://getdummyimage.com)
* [Imageholdr](http://imageholdr.com)
* [Ipsum Image](http://ipsumimage.appspot.com)
* [Placebox.es](http://placebox.es)
* [Placehold.it](http://placehold.it)

Though the colors of the avatars are randomly generated, options like fonts and font size (if applicable) can be selected from the admin panel on the Discussion settings page.

This plugin is highly extendable through various filters. For example you can:
* Add your own placeholder services, with service options.
* Set the avatar colors on a per-user basis.
* Change the user name field to select the initials from.

== Installation ==

1. Place the 'initials-default-avatar' folder in your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate Initials Default Avatar.
3. Visit 'Settings > Discussion' and enable Initials as your default avatar.
4. Select a placeholder service, set some service options to your liking and hit save.
5. Enjoy your freshly colored comment threads.

== Other Notes ==

1. Initials are based on the user display name as selected on the user profile page. For unregistered commenters the comment author name is used.
